    TERABOT:{
        TITLE: "terabot",
        INTRO:"As per International Standards Organization’s defines of an industrial robot, mobile robot can be defined as ‚A mobile robot is an autonomous system capable of traveling a terrain with natural or artificial obstacles. Its chassis is equipped with linkage wheels and possibly a manipulator setup mounted on the chassis for handling of work pieces, tools or special devices. Various pre-planned operations are executed based on a pre-programmed navigation strategy taking into account the current status of the environment. This definition any intelligent machine which moves with respect to environment within limited human interface (autonomously) called ‚Mobile robot‛. Mobile robots can be classified by significant properties as; Locomotion (wheeled) Suspension (independent drive), Steering (Skid), Control (Fully-Autonomous, semi- autonomous) and Usage Area (Rough Terrain, even surface). Mobile robots can be used in several applications. Dangerous area operations like Nuclear plants, planetary exploration and pipe investigation, extreme temperature and narrow field investigations (pyramid exploration robots). Floor cleaning robots and servant robots are common examples for indoor use. It is not a dream that, in near future robots will be a part of our daily life. There is no doubt that a mobile robot’s most important part is its locomotion system which determines the stability and capacity while traversing on rough terrain. The difference of robotic locomotion is distinct from traditional types in that it has to be more reliable without human interaction. While constructing a robot, designer must have decided on the terrain requirements like stability criteria, obstacle height, and surface friction. There is no only one exact solution while comparing the mobility systems. There are several types of locomotion mechanisms were designed depending on nature of the terrain. Locomotion systems can be divided into groups as; wheeled, tracked, legged (walking robots), limbless (snake and serpentine robots) and hopping robots. Wheeled rough terrain mobile robots are called as ‚Rover‛",

        INTRO:"Excavators are heavy construction equipment consisting of a boom, stick, bucket and cab on a rotating platform known as the \"house\". The house sits atop an undercarriage with tracks or wheels. A cable-operated excavator uses winches and steel ropes to accomplish the movements. They are a natural progression from the steam shovels and often mistakenly called power shovels. All movement and functions of a hydraulic excavator are accomplished through the use of hydraulic fluid, with hydraulic cylinders and hydraulic motors. Due to the linear actuation of hydraulic cylinders, their mode of operation is fundamentally different from cable-operated excavators.",

            TITLE:"We are going to design a chair for Excavator machine which is hydraulically adjusted. We will try to maintain chair at horizontal position means when Excavator machine operate on incline path we will change the position by adjusting the chair with some angle and try to maintain it at horizontal position. Also we use accelerometer for measuring inclination angle and by using this input we adjust the chair automatically. Thus by considering the ergonomics factors, we have designed an automatic adjusting chair for Pokland machine. As a result the operator feels comfortable and does the work more efficiently while doing work on incline surface. The new design of chair maintains the C.G. of operator as the Pokland machine moves on incline path. The range of inclined of chair is 400, for moving chair through this range hydraulic system is suggested and the different components are selected accordingly.",

            INTRO:"The present invention pertains to the material handling systems and more particularly to the forklift horn which can be operated automatically or can be operated by giving warning to the forklift operator to take action/caution. There are several factors to be considered for the selection of a right forklift for the job, through which the risks associated with operation of the forklifts can be prevented, thus reducing the risk of workplace injury. The factors can include:",
            PARAGRAPHS:[
                "Workers being hit, pinned or crushed by forklifts: If forklifts are in operation, they have to honk each and every corner of workplace or taking exit or entering in the workplace if they don’t do so it worker could be struck, pinned or even crushed by a forklift, which can result in serious or even fatal injuries. Workers are most commonly struck when they’re in the blind spots of the forklift operators. Other causes are when there is overcrowding on the warehouse floor or a poor warehouse layout that puts both forklift operators and workers in danger. As a result, blind spots, warehouse layout and speed are most commonly recognised for these serious injuries.",
                "Forklift Overturning: Overturning is responsible for almost 25% of all forklift related accidents and causes the most severe injuries. Forklifts are designed with most of their weight in the back of the vehicle to evenly distribute the weight of the load. They also turn with their back wheels, meaning that if the weight is uneven, it can cause the vehicle to spin out and overturn. An uneven distribution of weight is the most common way a forklift can overturn but there are a number of ways it can happen. Carrying excess or unusual loads, an obstructed view of the operator and raising heavy loads to considerable heights can also result in forklifts being overturned.",
                "Loads falling from an extended Forklift: Forklifts are commonly used to transfer or lift loads in warehouses and can also be used by workers to reach these heights. However, without the proper pallet attachments, lifting anything can be fatal or result in serious injury. Forklift hazards often occur when there is a change of balance for the vehicle. Lifting materials up high can cause the machine to overturn or for its load to fall. Make sure to always secure loads and ensure that it’s balanced or stable before lifting the load for the safety of the floor workers and forklift operator.",
            ],
            END:"In today’s era we believe in fast pace environment to work with but when it comes with warehouse management, we need some fast forklift operations in place. Working as a forklift driver must be tiring job for a whole day so It might affect or cause an accident in workplace. The operator or driver would have to honk each and every corner or blind spot of the organisation to see if any pedestrian or worker is not coming in their way but at some point, driver fails to honk horn because of tiredness or due to negligence which can cause undesirable situations. In order to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks associated with the forklift operation, there is a need for a system and method to which uses the automatic forklift horn control technology to reduce accidents in fast pace workplaces.
